Cee-Lo Dice

Game History: 
Cee-lo is a gambling game played with three six-sided dice. There is not one standard set of rules, but there are some constants that hold true to all sets of rules. The name comes from the Chinese Sì-Wŭ-Liù (四五六), meaning "four-five-six". In America it is also called "See-Low," "Four-Five-Six," "The Three Dice Game," "Chinchirorin," and by several alternative spellings, as well as simply "Dice."

Overview

For project #1, I created a simple game of Cee-Lo Dice.


Once player comes to the site, they are shown the rules of the game. Once they understand the rules of the game, they are given the option to "buy in" and begin their game against the computer. The player is assigned three free coins to begin playing.

Each player gets a turn to roll three dice simultaneuosly. The goal is to roll the dice until they achieve either:
1. A Single Point roll - Where two dice are matching and the outlying number produces a "single point score". The higher number of these scores wins the round.
2. A Triples roll - Where all three dice are matching in which they recieve a "triples score" in which the matching number is their "triples score". Triples scores automatically beat single point scores but when both players have triples, the higher triples score wins the round. 
3. A Winning/Losing roll - No matter what roll the other player has, if a player rolls a "1, 2, 3", it is an automatic loss and if a player rolls a "4, 5, 6" it is an automatic win. 
At the end of each round, the winner is given a coin from the loser. The human player then has the option to keep playing or "cash out" which will exit the game.
